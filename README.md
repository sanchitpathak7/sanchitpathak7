With a strong background in large-scale distributed systems, I have working knowledge in technologies like Kubernetes, OpenStack, Terraform, Linux, and Cloud Networking.

I have more than five years of experience in product development, infrastructure design, and product support within both public and private cloud environments. Currently, as a Software Engineer, I focus on implementing Kubernetes controllers and operators using Golang. My work includes fixing product defects, ensuring proper metrics and telemetry for monitoring, developing microservice integrations with Auth0 and Stripe, and designing CI/CD pipelines to streamline code integrations.
